//  
You are given an array of N distinct elements numbered from 1 to N. 
You need to draw some elements from this array such that no two consecutive elements are drawn.

Write a program to find the total number of distinct ways of drawing the elements from this array.

Since the number can be huge hence print answer modulo 10^9 + 7.

Input format : 

  First line: T (Number of test cases)
  Next T lines: N

Output format :

  For each test case, print the total number of distinct ways of drawing the elements from the array modulo 10^9 + 7.

Constraints :

  1 <= T <= 10^3
  1 <= N <= 10^9

Sample Input : 
  2
  1 
  4

Sample Output : 
  1
  7
